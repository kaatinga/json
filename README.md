# A basic JSON value extractor

This package is inspired by Dave Cheney and his article '[Building a high performance JSON parser](https://dave.cheney.net/high-performance-json.html)'.

This is quite common that you need only one value from a huge JSON struct and in this case you may need something fast. Not the common JSON package.
